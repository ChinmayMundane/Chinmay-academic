H﻿i ! I am Chinmay Mundane, a pre-final year undergraduate student at the Department of Production Engineering , VJTI Mumbai. I am interested in researching more about the modularity in the mechanical design of robotics systems. Along with this, I am greatly interested in motion planning and perception of autonomous vehicles and currently working on the same.

O﻿ther than research, I love teaching. I have taken lot of workshops and lectures on pid control, bit images and forward kinematics for the underclassmen under the robotics club of my college and it is what i would like to pursue as a career along with research.

W﻿hen I am not doing the above, I prefer to read books, write poetry and play piano.
